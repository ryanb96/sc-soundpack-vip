pre-installation, only applicable to new installations,skip this section if upgrading.
before we continue to the installation, when creating the mud, the mud name should be called "Star Conquest" without the quotes. Capatalization is important! Please connect to it once before continuing to ensure the necessary folder is created.
Once that's done, move on to actual installation below.

actual Installation.
1. Once you've downloaded the pack from the release page, run the self-extracting executable, giving it a directory where to store it's files.  Just remember where it's located and be careful not to get folders mixed up if you are replacing a previous version of the pack.
Wherever you extracted this self-extracting archive  to, you will find a folder that will  contain either one of the following folder names.
full release: sc-release-full
scripts patch only: sc-release-scripts
sounds patch only: sc-release-sounds
2. Locate your VIPMud folder on your computer. This would be the folder that has your various mud files in it, not the soundpack folder.
It might look something like C:\Program Files (x86)\VipMud
or C:\Program Files\VipMud
If you're using the latest version of VIP mud which is 2.0, it may be installed in your Documents folder.
3. From within that folder, locate your sounds folder and open it. Then go to the soundpack that you have just downloaded and open its sound folder. Copy the star conquest folder and then paste it into your sounds folder.
4. Back out of the sounds folder and go to the star conquest folder. You will simply copy and paste your scripts folder settings, and star conquest.set file from the soundpack folder to this star conquest folder located in your Vipmud directory.
5. Copy "StarConquestBufferlist.txt"  into the route of your VIP Mud folder.
6. Copy "settings.set"  into the route of your "Star Conquest" folder inside your VIP Mud folder.
7. copy "Star Conquest.set"  into the route of your "Star Conquest" folder inside your VIP Mud folder.
