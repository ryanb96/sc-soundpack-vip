Version 2.8
We got rid of some bari combat sounds that only seemed to trigger sometimes.
In the name of not having a ton of sounds for one function, we got rid of several repair sounds.
We now have a bari scraping ship sound.
Fixed it so that the community1 channel actually uses a community1 sound instead of what will now be the OOC sound.
The sound when mother is preparing to use the laser is changed.
There should now be a sound when a MICE stands alone.
There is now a sound when something is blinded.
We added a different sound when an enemy turns toward you verses your allies with ground combat.
The patrol waypoint sound is fixed.
The rapid warp sound is fixed.
Changed the beta and uruz ability prep sound per request.
The energy core sound is fixed.
The error for looking while in a battlesuit is fixed. Thanks for the help Stephen.
*Fixed a typo in the Welcome Back to Star Conquest trigger.
* Added a sound for OOCly room messages.
* Added a sound for another SAY trigger.
* Added a wears off trigger for flurry on the Turttle battlesuit.
* Fixed the Bob and Weave wears off trigger for the turttle battlesuit.
* Added the same sound for moving under BOOST power for when the starship starts moving if AFTERBURNER is on.
* Changed the RDICE command to RDI. I know, it's so small but it wasn't rolling dice, it was rolling one 6-sided di.
* Lowered the roundtime sound as it was quite loud.
* Updated the sounds folder version to 2, as it should've really been updated to 2 under version 2.7.
* Removed a few old things that the soundpack no longer needs.
* Fixed it so you hear it say that all text has been gagged if you use the SHIFT-F12 key.
* Social sounds will no longer play if all sounds are off. Oops.

* Please update the entire sounds and scripts folders along with the StarConquest.set file
version 2.7
The roundtime sound has been changed.
There was a sound changed dealing with cores for the breach pods.
Alass, we may have a rapid assault sound.
The flare sound is fixed.
Fixed some text in the peoplecontrib.
* Made it easier for us to update the date that the soundpack was last modified.
* If sounds are off it no longer turns off the triggers for some PA messages.
* Fixed another trigger to do with the PA messages, and cleaned up something else with PA code.
* Added control+F12 to check settings of your soundpack.
* Added the RELOADSP command, to reload the soundpack. It will play a beep once it has completed the reload.
* Added a RDICE command, complete with a sound of rolling dice to roll a dice through the soundpack.
* Added a LENGTH command which opens a prompt dialog box to check the length of a string.
* Did a rework of the CHANONE and CHANTWO prompts. You won't notice much userside, other than it tells you once it sets the channels name what it sets it to. This might help you notice a typo if you have one. I think I changed something else with one of the commands in there, but it's currently almost 4 A.M, and I'm tired. Goodnight, soundpack.
* Yeah, our e-mail address really reads scsoundpack@gmail.com. Yay!
* Added a little beep once landing is complete, so that you don't try and power down while landing. This should help it so people don't crash their ships.
* Added the credits sound when you submit planets, and when you pay for your belt workers.
* You'll now hear social sounds along with the channel sound with whatever you set as your first community channel. It only worked correctly for the second one, but now the first works.
* We've rewritten the Star Conquest.set file for loading features. Also I know it's in the same update, but with this change redid the RELOADSP command.
* Made a tiny change to a trigger for ground combat.
* Made it so you get the warning about your damage going over a percentage, along with enemies. If you don't like it, we can put it back.
* Added more sounds for trains (just fixed a few triggers) and added a home made train whistle sound.
* Maybe made it so that if you install the soundpack for the first time with the settings.set file, communication sounds should come enabled. If they don't, please hit CONTROL+F1! Thanks.
* Made it so you have a sound when you enter a ship again.
* Added the little beep to alert that you're landed on an asteroid, much like planets and stations.
* Removed Sapi from the soundpack.

version 2.6
Added a few links to the website, and made the website meet WCAG 2.0 guidelines.
Changed the wears off sound that we have for text such as illuminate, radiate and more.
Added a sound for when someone other than yourself flares.
We now have a sound that indicates if there is an open mic in the room. You can hear it when you walk into a room as well as just typing l or look.
Fixed an error that I caused in version 2.5. Hopefully nobody noticed it.
Added sounds for the new megapod breach.
There should be a sound for when you cause a traceback.
The leadership sound for rift linked ships is now fixed.
The asteroid landing sound has a decent chance of being fixed.
Finished clean up of the ground combat and space combat folders, probably.
* Added a sound for when you talk to a ship buddy. No, I wasn't creative and it uses the normal robot say sound.
* Moved all the robot and catbott stuff out of misc.set under misc heading, and put it into Robot.set. I plan on doing more with ship buddys when I get more text, but for now you get what you get.
* Added a toggle for robot sounds. This includes catbots. It's F2.
* Maybe made it so that robot sounds come enabled.
* Made it so that if the soundpacks sounds were turned off with F11, it would really turn off all the sounds. We're sorry about this if you've noticed it at all. If you notice any sounds that are still playing when the sounds are off, pleace send us an e-mail to our e-mail, and let us know which sound it is. The text for the sound would be nice, so that we can find it easier!
* Combined two other triggers into one.
* Added Robots.set and Felo.set into one set file. It's PetsAndRobots.set.
* Made it so that you can turn Felo sounds on and off, (they come enabled by default). The command is F3.
* I think we're still on version 2.6? Added the shovel sound when ship buddy's help out. Also added the sound for when other people's ship buddy's help as well.
* Added a note of where to find your VIP mud folder if you're using version 2.0 or later of the client into the README file.
* Finally gave Melinda Michaels proper recognition for her assistance with the soundpack, as she's done more to help than her little blerb was alluding too. This reflects in the PEOPLCONTRIB command and the welcome text when the first soundpack loads. It'll also be noted on the website. Thank you, Melinda. Your help is appreciated. She was a key part in many areas of the soundpack	
* At Melinda Michaels suggestion, added a link for the ReadMe file which could help install the soundpack if you're having any trouble with it on the website.
* Added with better support a GagAllText, or SHIFT-F12 commands. Gag your incoming speach. This version works better than the old one that was removed whenever that was. Please note if you have all of your text gagged, and you reload the soundpack with CONTROL-SHIFT-R, or through the connect menu after hitting the AULT key that you'll have all your speach gagged. VIP MUD is stupid and doesn't reset the GAG INCOMING SPEACH function. You have to type GagAllText twice, or hit SHIFT-F12 twice. If you notice any problems, please do let us know. Oh, one last thing to note it doesn't have this setting when the soundpack saves. It still applies to the reason for the last time we put this feature in. Have fun!
* Changed the date of something on the website, but it doesn't really matter because y'all may notice it's been fixed before this changelog goes live.
* Added a roundtime completion sound again. You can turn it on and off with CONTROL+F3. It doesn't take in acount (Another 3 seconds rounddtime) yet, but I'm working on it. It also saves across connections with the saving of soundpack settings.
* Updated support for hearing when a ship is locked or unlocked while standing inside, with the new system.
* Added  links to the website  for the following things: 1. Download just the script files. This will reflect in the change logs from now on, if it's just a script file update, and not sounds. 2. You can download just the sounds folder if required, and not the scripts. The changelog will also start to reflect this. 3. You can download both the sounds folder and scripts folder in a bundle like it currently is. We'll notify in the changelog as well from now on. Hope this helps people that have slower internet, datacaps wow they're really still around, or just someone that doesn't want to delete the sounds folder after downloading it if it's not required.
* Added a sound for when a Bari Spreader is in the sector if you view the RUNDOWN command.
* Have the roundtime compleetion sound in the soundpack, but it does currently error when an enemy gives you more round time when you already have some. I'm working on a fix, but can't figure it out right this moment. If anyone knows away to get it to work, feel free to e-mail me the code! We'll even put you in the notes!
* Sapi will now alert you that there is a Bari Spreader in the sector. If you think it's to slow, yell at me and I might change it.

version 2.5

Added rift drive repair completion sounds.
Added sounds for a mine resuming and pausing.
Continued organizing the set files for better ease of access. For example, in the ship file, ;lights will take you to triggers dealing with lights. This isn't a big important thing and probably doesn't matter but it will look nice. We've got a ways to go for this to be complete.
Added the airlock set file into the ship file.
The alarmingly loud news reader sound has finally been replaced. Unless you liked that sound, in which case, we are sorry.
Added a patrol waypoint and autonavigation switch sounds.
Removed a bunch of the sounds that were in the ground and combat folders.
Increased the acceleration and deceleration sound volume.
Changed the channel 1 and 2 sounds.
* Added a sound for a bari pod being destroyed by a plasma bomb.
* Fixed the broken  Welcome back to Star Conquest! - trigger.
* Combined the salvaging and scooping.set files into SalvagingANDScooping.set.
* Fixed the following trigger: You hear support drones within the space station's docking bay working diligently on the outside of the starship.
* Maybe added a sound for the crane loading station parts into a mod transport while on the landing pad. Maybe.
* Added a sound for the spacesuit radio. Shocking, right?
* Fixed the text that has our e-mail address in it. VIP was stripping the @GMAIL part. We're sorry.
* Oops. Added a sound for someone leaving MTTS (or messages to the staff).
* Added a sound for this line. There is some debris or an asteroid at that location.
* Added an identification sound and calibration sound for hypercasters on ships.
* Most likely made it so the stupid sneeze sound didn't play when someone just says the word. No one knows.
* Updated the text for when Enemies have appeared at a path when doing Tesla arch sites.

version 2.4
* Rewrote the entirety (mainly)? of the KEYS.SET file. You will for sure not have problems turning things on and off.
* Renamed the ORGSET command to CHANONE (that's the word ONE) for the default channel. Updated the soundpack saving settings for this, too.
* Added a CHANTWO command (that's the word TWO) for the secondary community channel, and made the trigger work for it. It will also save with your soundpack settings, and load with them when you connect again.
* Because we suck, uploaded an old Settings.set file to fix a bunch of loading errors people (all of us ran into). You'll for sure have to up date your community channel names, and perhaps a few settings. We are sorry!
* Best change to ever hit the soundpack. Starting at this version, (2.4) the soundpack once again will be a .zip file. Sorry for everyone that had trouble opening and or extracting .7z, and .7zip, or .rar. Space isn't a problem.
Merged the asteroid hauling and mining files.
Started reorganizing the triggers in the combat and misc file. Nothing important.
Merged Tesla and GMG files into the ground set file.
Merged the random and misc set files.
Got rid of a couple chaingun sounds.
Updated the keys help file to reflect the community channel change from the old org channels.
Got rid of some beep and shovel sounds and fixed the .set files, hopefully.
At long last, we have pod sounds, enjoy!
Removed the IFS key and changed the laser hitting ship triggers back to just gagline voice. There were some issues for people with this is the reason we changed it back to how it used to be.
Added a buzz sound for the apartments.
Added a couple of taxi sounds.
Changed more triggers from gagline all to gagline voice.
Added some voice gags for enemies hitting the hull and such to the combat file.
* Removed some stuff for the settings file that was used before. Melinda is destroying everything! Kidding kidding. If your settings.set file fucks up for a little, I'm sorry. Don't kill me. I tried. Go a head and remove the fourth item from the list in the settings.set file and save it.
* Updated the keys text file.
* May have fixed a problem that some of you ran into where changing a setting, like turning comm sounds on and off would throw an error. If it still breaks I'll just rewrite the keys.set file once and for all.

version 2.3
Because Jason is forgetful, we have a new email address. This one will not be forgotten because both of us have the necessary information. scsoundpack@gmail.com.
I rewrote the peoplecontrib text.
I rewrote the website again. You can now email us directly from the site as well as grabbing the address from the soundpack once you log on to Star Conquest.
I added a healing is complete sound for the creche. I actually did this one awhile back but forget when so here it is.
I fixed some typos in the keys.set file.
I cleaned up the airlock, salvaging and hauling files.
I added a timer sound for the chronometer.
We have new sounds for landing, launching, ftl, hauling, enter, exit and change sector. This is another work in progress as we try to replace many of the sounds.
Fixed spelling of enemy in two ground sounds and the set file. Let us know if you spot spelling errors.
Removed a bunch of sounds from the general misc, ship misc, ship computer, and ship move folders. Also updated their respective .set files. This is a work in progress as we continue to clean up the pack.

Version: 2.2
* Rewrote all of the muting of the soundpack. Now it doesn't ignore all of the triggers when you use the F11 key to mute the soundpack. This will also make it so that it saves your soundpack settings when you type QUIT if the sounds are all turned off.
* Added back in ship hit gagging thanks to Melinda for pointing this out. Sorry.
* Ship hit gagging can be turned on and off with Control+F6
Fixed something with the movement inside of battlesuits, and made Jason strip some stuff from the old system out of the GMG.set file.
* Fixed a few things in the ground and ship files.
* The cash sound will now play when you DRAIN a credit chip.
* F5 will now turn phone sounds on and off.
* Updated the KEYS help file for the new phones command.
* Updated the phones.set file to be able to turn the phone sounds on and off.
* Added a trigger for the Thorn ground combat enemy.
* Added a sound for when felo eat from a nutrigel unit.
* You will now see who powers up the starship.
* Control+Shift+F1 will mute and unmute the incoming speech. It won't save when your soundpack saves the settings or reload. This is so that no one flips out and says I broke the soundpack.
* Rewrote the PEOPLECONTRIB command.
* You will now hear a sound when you're standing outside of a ship and someone boards it with a group!

Version: 2.1
* When the crappy text in the loading of the soundpack is read about who I am and that it's the Star Conquest soundpack, it now says the version that you're running.
* Fixed grammer in some stuff in the version lines throughout this changelog file. No one cares.
* Fixed something strange with something in the Mining.set file. It was splitting a trigger in the wrong place.
* Fixed a bad linebreak in the Misc.set file.
* Fixed it so that when you TRASH a paper, letter, report, or anything else like that it makes the sound of someone crushing up paper. No clue why this was gone.
* Control+F2 turns oven sounds on and off.
* Added a sound for when ovens ding when done cooking.
* Fixed it so the org channel sound fires when a social is done over the channel.
* Fixed it so that the laugh sound triggers over communication channels. Tareable.
* Moved something from the gags file to the vars file. I bet you can't guess what it is?
* Added it so that you can hear the text about the iffs hitting you right away, or it will gagline voice it.
* Control+F3 to change the iffs toggle.
* Updated the ReadMe file. Please Read the ReadMe file. It has a cool note about the settings.set file.

Version: 2.0
* Major update! We now have the ability to save settings. If you turn social sounds off, and log out, no more being be enraged with the fact that they are back on again when you log back into the game. All settings will update to the current whenever you log out of the game, and reload once you connect. You can also use the F12 key to save them if you wish. Note, you have to type QUIT for the settings to save when logging out of Star Conquest. The following settings will be saved: Main soundpack volume, Social sounds, Master mute and unmute, Gaggs, RoomSounds, and Org. I'm sure there will be more to come in the future! Sorry this took forever.
* You now have a new settings file. Please leave it where the Star Conquest.set file is, and the scripts folder. It doesn't need to be in the scripts folder.
* Rewrote the F9 and F10 keys. Volume won't go over 100 percent, and it displays some stuff better. It also now doesn't control the room sounds volume.
* CONTROL + F9 to lower room sounds volume, and Control + F10 to make the room sounds louder.
* Rewrote the master mute and unmute toggle F11.
* Completely stripped room sounds out of the soundpack until I can be bothered to rewrite them.
* Added sound panning back into the ground combat fort stuff, because I removed it without meaning.
* Rewrote the hole soundpack! It now has much better organization, and cleaner code that made it load better, and parse better!
* Want to turn off all communacation sounds without muting the soundpack? Ask no more! You can now hit the control + f1 key to turn them on and off!
* Removed a few useless gag's, and fixed a few sounds that didn't play. Also removed a few duplakit triggers. Tried to combined a few triggers into 1.
* Fixed it so that if you really logged out of the game with all sounds off that they would stay off the next time you connected. Note, if you change a setting and you have sounds off, you need to hit F12 again before you log out to save it. Typing QUIT at this point won't work.
* Fixed it so it doesn't save the settings file in your main VIP mud directory.
* Added I think the last door close sound that the soundpack needed. Note I could be wrong!
* Added a KEYS command. This will open the KEYS file inside of the files folder, that explains what all of the commands for the soundpack are.
* Added some grammer to the VERSION command. Also fixed all of the VERSION lines here in the ChangeLog. Woo!
* Jasons changes will have the star before it! Not that it matters who's is who's.
The capsule really does stop making sounds once you exit it now.
Added some mining sounds and changed others.
Fixed an issue with the engineering tools volume.
Hopefully the turns toward will work for enemies turning towards everyone now.
Added the readme file into the files folder. The files folder is housed inside of the scripts folder inside of the Star Conquest folder. This will help you learn how to install the soundpack.
* Added a README command. It'll open the README file.
* Added a sound for when nests are detected in the sector with the RUNDOWN command.
* Fixed the sound for when you check your ships charge.
* This is after the first upload, but whatever. Fixed an error when the soundpack first loads, because the settings.set file didn't have a sound for the master volume to play at.

Version: 1.8
* Added a sound for the following line of text: The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.
* Added a gag for when you talk into the rift microphone. It's still going to show up in the output window.
* Added a muted and unmuted sound for your phones. Switching your phone to mute, will say muted. Switching your phone to unmuted, will say unmuted. Looking at your phone will say muted if it is indeed muted.

Version: 1.7
Added outsider patrol sounds.
Fixed some Tesla stuff.
changed a trigger to fix ship room sounds not turning off when exiting capsules. If you are using brief, you will currently need to look to turn sounds back on when entering a ship, maybe.
Added some rift comm link sounds.
Mentor channel now has a sound.
Fixed the flight control scanner sound.
org notification sound now works with gags on.
Either fixed or major broke the battlesuit move sound. It should only work when in a battlesuit. If you get disconnected while inside your suit, you will need to just do a quick look to get the move sound enabled.
Rewrote the website.
* Cleaned up the changelog file. All the newest changes are at the top of the file.
* I'm back! Fixed a little bug that made it so saying something to someone with social sounds off doesn't play a beautiful ding sound.
* Changed the new chained sound for good. Silly coppy and replace.
* Made it so that the radio sound won't play for scooping if social sounds are off.
* Fixed a typo in the PEOPLECONTRIB command.
* Added a sound for when you're going through a wormhole, and you or someone standing in the room with you collapses.
* Most likely fixed all the mentor channel stuff.
* Rewrote the VERSION command. Put it into the keys.set file, because it's kind of a key, and didn't have to be in the Star Conquest.set file.
