This file will explain how to get your soundpack up and running.

Small note! If you're updating to a newer soundpack, and you've already installed a version that has the settings.set file, you don't need to use the new one. Keep your old one, so that you don't have to input your community channel channels name again, and all that fun jaz.

1. Once you've downloaded the pack, run the self-extracting executable, giving it a directory where to store it's files.  Just remember where it's located and be careful not to get folders mixed up if you are replacing a previous version of the pack.

2. Locate your VIPMud folder on your computer. This would be the folder that has your various mud files in it, not the soundpack folder.
It might look something like C:\Program Files (x86)\VipMud
or C:\Program Files\VipMud
If you're using the latest version of VIP mud which is 2.0, it may be installed in your Documents folder.

3. From within that folder, locate your sounds folder and open it. Then go to the soundpack that you have just downloaded and open its sound folder. Copy the star conquest folder and then paste it into your sounds folder.

4. Back out of the sounds folder and go to the star conquest folder. You will simply copy and paste your scripts folder settings, and star conquest.set file from the soundpack folder to this star conquest folder located in your Vipmud directory.
